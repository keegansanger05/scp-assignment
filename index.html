        SCP-002, also known as "The Living Room," is an anomalous object classified as Euclid by the SCP Foundation. 
        It resembles a large, fleshy tumor with a hollow, interior space that mimics the appearance of a living room. 
        The interior is furnished with a variety of objects, including furniture and decorations, all of which appear 
        to be made from biological matter similar to human tissue. When individuals come into close proximity 
        with SCP-002, they may feel an inexplicable compulsion to enter the structure. Once inside, they are absorbed 
        and their body parts are converted into new furniture or decor, seamlessly blending into the room's existing 
        layout. Due to its highly dangerous nature, SCP-002 is kept under strict containment, and access is limited 
        to authorized personnel only.

            SCP-003, also known as "Biological Motherboard," is a highly anomalous object resembling a complex circuit 
            board composed of biological tissue. Discovered in a hidden underground chamber, SCP-003 exhibits the ability
            to interface with electronic devices and systems, manipulating them in unforeseen ways. It operates through
            a form of biological circuitry that integrates seamlessly with technology, allowing it to exert control over
            connected devices. The SCP Foundation has classified SCP-003 as Euclid due to its unpredictable effects 
            and the potential security risks posed by its interaction with electronic systems. Containment protocols
            are focused on preventing unauthorized access and ensuring the object remains isolated from external 
            technology.

                SCP-004, known as "The Door," is an anomalous object consisting of twelve rusted keys and a corresponding 
                door with a lock. The keys and door, when used together, can unlock a variety of unexpected and often 
                dangerous phenomena. Each key opens the door to a different, highly variable location or condition, some 
                of which can be extremely hazardous. The effects range from seemingly mundane rooms to locations with lethal
                 environmental hazards or anomalous entities. Due to the unpredictable nature of the keys and their 
                 potentially lethal outcomes, SCP-004 is classified as Euclid, and strict containment procedures are enforced
                  to manage and study its unpredictable effects safely.

            SCP-005, also known as "The Skeleton Key," is an anomalous key that possesses the ability to unlock any lock, 
            regardless of complexity or security measures. It appears as a standard antique key, but its properties allow 
            it to bypass all forms of physical and electronic locking mechanisms. SCP-005's effects are not limited to 
            conventional locks; it can also unlock previously inaccessible or anomalous barriers. Due to its versatile 
            and potentially dangerous capabilities, SCP-005 is classified as Euclid and is kept under strict security to 
            prevent misuse. Its containment includes rigorous controls to ensure that it remains secured and its applications
            are carefully monitored.

            SCP-006, known as "The Fountain of Youth," is an anomalous spring located in a remote and uninhabited region. 
            The water from SCP-006 has rejuvenating properties that reverse aging and heal injuries, effectively granting 
            its drinkers extended longevity and vitality. However, the effects are not without side effects; prolonged 
            exposure can lead to severe psychological and physiological changes, including erratic behavior and physical 
            distortions. The fountain's water also has unpredictable effects on individuals with pre-existing conditions 
            or genetic anomalies. Due to its potent and potentially hazardous properties, SCP-006 is classified as Euclid, 
            and its location is kept confidential to prevent unauthorized access and exploitation.
