                Special Containment Procedures:
                <br>
                SCP-003 is to be maintained at a constant temperature of no less than 35°C and ideally kept above 100°C. 
                No living multicellular organisms of Category IV or higher complexity may be allowed to come into contact 
                with SCP-003.
                <br><br>
                In event of total power failure, if SCP-003-1 begins to increase its mass, assigned personnel must engage 
                in skin contact with SCP-003-1. Ideally, personnel may use their body heat to return SCP-003-1 to above the 
                critical temperature; however, skin contact must be maintained even in event of SCP-003 reaching activation 
                temperature, lasting at minimum until SCP-003-1 advances fully to its second growth stage.
                <br><br>
                Personnel who enter SCP-003's containment area must first be examined for body parasites of Category IV or 
                higher complexity, and sterilized if such organisms are present. All personnel who have come in physical
                 contact with SCP-003-1 are to immediately report for sterilization afterwards.
                <br><br>
                SCP-003-1 must not be removed from SCP-003-2 except in case of emergency procedures detailed above. Any 
                significant change in SCP-003-2's rune activity (including pattern, frequency, or color) should be reported 
                within three (3) hours of occurrence. Cessation of rune activity must be reported immediately. SCP-003-2 must
                 be supplied with power via the source designated Generator 003-IX at all times.
                <br><br>
                Description:
                <br>
                SCP-003 consists of two related components of separate origin, referred to as SCP-003-1 and SCP-003-2.
                <br><br>
                SCP-003-1 appears to be composed of chitin, hair, and nails of unknown biology, arranged in a configuration 
                similar to that of a computer motherboard. Testing reveals SCP-003-1 to predate earliest known circuit boards
                 by a factor of thousands of years. SCP-003-1 is considered sentient but not actively dangerous except under 
                 certain conditions.
                <br><br>
                SCP-003-1 was found on a stone tablet, SCP-003-2, on which it currently resides. The runes on SCP-003-2 are 
                not part of any known language, and emit pale, flickering light patterns.
                <br><br>
                SCP-003-2 is controlled by a (non-biological) internal computer, the contents of which are mostly inaccessible 
                without risk of damaging SCP-003-2. SCP-003-2 is capable of controlled emissions of radiation, including heat, 
                light, and anomalous radiation types. SCP-003-2 contains an internal power source of an anomalous nature, 
                which appears to have been losing power since several centuries before discovery.
                <br><br>
                It is considered probable that SCP-003-2 was created for the purpose of containing SCP-003-1. Partially 
                interpreted data recovered from SCP-003-2 may refer to a past and/or potential future LK-class restructuring
                 event caused by SCP-003-1.
                <br><br>
                SCP-003 was located by remote viewing team SRV-04 Beta. It appears possible that SRV-04 Beta was deliberately
                 contacted by SCP-003-2. Other organizations have also been alerted to SCP-003's existence, possibly by 
                 similar means. Despite this activity, SCP-003-2 does not appear to be sentient, based on its lack of reaction 
                 to M03-Gloria analysis and procedures.
                <br><br>
                When SCP-003 drops below the temperature of 35°C, both components react.
                <br><br>
                First, SCP-003-1 enters a growth state characterized by an exponential increase in mass. This growth state 
                consists of two stages. In both stages, SCP-003-1 partially fuels its growth by converting matter around 
                it, starting with any surrounding inorganic material, including atmospheric elements, then nonliving organic
                 material, including cells of dead skin, hair, chitin, enamel, keratin, and other biological materials.
                <br><br>
                The first stage is always the same. SCP-003-1 will first increase its mass, then take a form similar in 
                shape to an ophiuroid (brittle star) of fifteen meters in diameter (including what appears to be a central 
                processor of three meters in diameter). It will form sensory organs that appear to scan its surrounding 
                environment, and will partially convert the area around it to an unidentified anomalous substance 
                (SCP-003-2 seems immune from conversion).
                <br><br>
                The second stage describes a growth alteration which occurs when SCP-003 comes into contact with living 
                organic material; SCP-003 appears to "template" itself off of the organic material, and will attempt 
                communication with organisms that match its initial "template" or "templates".
                <br><br>
                In its second stage, SCP-003-1 may pause, slow or change its growth, and will also convert inorganic and 
                nonliving organic elements into functionally similar structures while anomalously altering their physical 
                makeup.
                <br><br>
                SCP-003-1's biology has been the subject of extensive study. Significant elements have been identified similar
                to SCP-███, SCP-1512, and SCP-2756, the latter two of which have no further confirmed connection with 
                SCP-003-1 and no known connection with each other, and none of which are fully understood (technically, 
                even less understood than SCP-003, thanks to the extensive cross-disciplinary research on 
                the SCP-003 objects). To date, no convincing analysis has been put forward which satisfactorily explains SCP-003-1's connection to these SCP objects or others, nor its connection to modern technology beyond appearance (and potential mimicry via unknown mechanism).
